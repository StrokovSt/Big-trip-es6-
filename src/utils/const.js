  `is the capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan. In 1876, the walled city was painted for a visit by Britain's Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), since when it has been known as 'the pink city'.`,
  `- the very name evokes exotic images. In fact, many parts of the city - including the modern airport - are not so different from other cities in developing countries, but the centre is truly historic and immediately one leaves the city one enters a world which is almost medieval.`,
  `has to be one of the most exciting cities on earth and I never fail to be thrilled when I visit it (I've been six times now). One of the most exciting times was when my wife, my son and I took a helicopter trip around those wonderful Manhattan skyscrapers.`,
  `is the city where effectively the United States was founded and one has to see Carpenters Hall, the site of the first continental congress of 1774, and Independence Hall, the site of the proclamation and signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.`,
  `is a dour place: many of the buildings were destroyed in a powerful earthquake in 1966 and much of the city features the utilitarian design of the Soviet period. But Samarkand is an utterly different proposition.`,
